# 42-Exam__Rank02-Recursive-gnl-

This is my solution to the get_next_line problem of the 42 exam Rank-02.

The exam version of such problem is the equivalent of the mandatory-only part of the homonymous project of the 42cursus common-core.
For a detailed explanation of the problem you can read the [Subject.txt] present in this repo. (essentially, the problem is about reading files one line at the time).

**I solved this problem in a recursive fashion**. Executing this program against the Tripouille tester ( https://github.com/Tripouille/gnlTester ) inside VS CODE's integrated terminal can show you some TIMEOUTS: **execute this program in your own machine's terminal and you'll be ok!**
